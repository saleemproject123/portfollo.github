An automated system for material return from customers streamlines the process of
returning products or goods to a business by leveraging technology. It simplifies the
task of receiving and processing return requests, which can otherwise be timeconsuming
and complex. Typically, such a system involves a software application
allowing customers to initiate return requests and providing return instructions. It also
enables businesses to efficiently manage returned inventory, process return requests,
and track return status in real-time, thereby improving overall efficiency and
customer satisfaction.
